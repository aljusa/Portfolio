# Research
### [Computational Drug Repositioning for Chagas Disease Using Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiling](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124270)
In this work, molecular docking and protein-ligand interaction profiling were perfomed on TcDHFR-TS to identify compounds with anti-*Tryanosoma* activity.

### [Ligand-Based and Structured-Based In Silico Repurposing Approaches to Predict Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Protein](https://doi.org/10.3390/scipharm88040054)
In this work, a combined virtual screening strategy was used to proposed chemical compounds with a high potential for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

### [Virtual Screening of FDA-Approved Drugs against Triose Phosphate Isomerase from Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia Identifies Inhibitors of Their Trophozoite Growth Phase](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115943)
In this work, a structure-based virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed to identify compounds with broad-spectrum antiprotozoal activity.
