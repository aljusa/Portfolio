### [Research 1: ]()
In this work, molecular docking and protein-ligand interaction profiling were perfomed on TcDHFR-TS to identify compounds with anti-*Tryanosoma* activity.

### [Research 2: ]()
In this work, a combined virtual screening strategy was used to proposed chemical compounds with a high potential for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

### [Research 3: ]()
In this work, a structure-based virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed to identify compounds with broad-spectrum antiprotozoal activity.
